<h1>Elements Package</h1>
<p>The Elements package contains classes that encapsulate different elements of musical phrase.</p>

<p>Here is a class diagram representing the structure of the package:</p>

<h2>Classes, Interfaces, and Enums</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<b>Event Interface</b>
<p>The Event interface is implemented by classes which represent 'events' as articulated within GTTM theory. It provides an interface for a method 'getDurationEnum()' which returns
 the durational length of the event. The durational length is measured in the lowest level of beats in the metrical structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>AttackEvent class</b>
<p>The AttackEvent class implements the Event interface and is used to represent the instantiation of a pitch as well as encapsulating the durational value of the pitch. </p>
</li>
<li>
<b>RestEvent class</b>
<p>The RestEvent class implements the Event interface and is used to represent the instantiation of a period of rest within the music, and further encapsulates the duration of that rest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>EventStream class</b>
<p>The EventStream class is used to encapsulate a stream of Event objects. It is used to represent a piece of music.</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>AttackEventChord class</b>
<p>The AttackEventChord class extends the AttackEvent class to encapsulate the instantiation of a chord of pitches, as well as its duration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>KeyLetterEnum enum-type </b>
<p>The KeyLetterEnum enum-type class is used to constrain the range of letters that can be associated with a Key class object. It is used to represent keys within the Western tonal tradition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>KeyPositionEnum enum-type</b>
<p>The KeyPositionEnum enum-type class is used to constrain the range of positions available for use in the music generator. It matches the position available on a keyboard and ranges from 1-8.</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Key class</b>
<p>The Key class is used to encapsulate details about a pitch at the point of instantiation. It defines the pitch frequency using KeyLetterEnum and KeyPositionEnum enum-type classes. </p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Scale Class</b>
<p>The Scale class is used to encapsulate a Western tonal tradition type scale. It defines a scale as a sequence of KeyLetterEnums</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>ConcreteScale class</b>
<p>The ConcreteScale class is used to encapsulate a Western tonal tradition type scale, and includes definite pitch positions for members of the scale. 
It defines a scale as a sequence of Key objects</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>DynamicsEnum enum-type</b>
<p>An enum-type that is used to describe different dynamic values for AttackEvent objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>ArticulationEnum enum-type</b>
<p>An enum-type that is used to describe different articulation values for AttackEvent objects.</p>
</li>

</ol>
