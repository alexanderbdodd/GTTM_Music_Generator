Hi Simon
Last minute question regarding the MSc corpus - we can't find the confirmation of ethics clearance for Alexander Dodd's MSc project. You queried (via Sandra) one odd thing in the form, which we clarified was a mistake. (See below) But now we can't find an email granting ethics clearance... My fault, I should have checked. Was Alex's project cleared?

Great - yes I wondered if that was the case. It is a bit confusing, sorry I couldn't help you in person with the form.

I’ll email Sandra back with the changed ‘tick’.

Hi Anna,

Apologies for that. I was confused about what the question was asking. I thought it was asking whether I would be able to identify the participants, rather than its being a purely anonymous participation. I wouldn't be looking to make the identities of any participants known to people other than myself, so I should have ticked no to that box.

Sorry for the error,

Alex

Hi Alex, I’ve just had this query regarding our ethics requirements for your MSc project.

I am not sure if we need to answer yes to this question on the ethics form? The question is asking about whether it will be possible for other people to identify who our participants are, from what you report in your MSc project write up.

Can evaluation be carried out, and can you write up the results, in a way which keeps the participants’ identities anonymous? If not, what would our justification be for revealing participants' identities?

Simon Thompson has reviewed this project registration form as School Research Ethics Advisor.  You have answered “yes” to the question “Will the outcome of the research allow respondents to be identified either directly or indirectly”.  He has asked for clarification since he cannot see how people need to be identified.
