<h2>Survey Data Analysis</h2>

<p>The data received from the survey has undergone several methods of analysis. In this section, the different kinds of analysis will be provided.</p>

<h3>Grounded Theory Analysis of Textual Responses</h3>
<p>The results received for the feedback section of the survey as well as the plain text indications of preference were treated to an informal grounded theory analysis. The aim was to
identify commonly recurring concepts featured in the responses.  </p>

<h3>Statistical Analysis</h3>

<p>The data was subjected to series of different forms of data analysis.</p>

<h2>Extraction of different data sets.</h2>
<p>The different sets of data were extracted according to the kind of music listeners the participant was classified as. Here are the sets which were extracted:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Original data set</b>
<p>This is the full set of data.</p>

</li>
<li>
<b>Set 1</b>
<p>This is the set of responses from participants that stated that they listened to classical music on a regular or very frequent basis.</p>
<p><a href="documents/survey/SET1.xls">Click here to see this data set.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Set 2</b>
<p>This is the set of preference choices from participants from SET1 which received a preferability score higher than 1. (i.e. responses which showed mild to strong preference for the pieces they chose)</p>
<p><a href="documents/survey/Set2.xls">Click here to see this data set.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Set 3</b>
<p>This is the set of responses from participants that stated that they listened to either traditional African, traditional Indian, traditional Oriental, or other world musics occasionally, regularly, or very frequently, 
and didn't listen to classical music regularly or very frequently.</p>
<p><a href="documents/survey/SET3.xls">Click here to see this data set.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Set 4</b>
<p>This is the set of participants that stated that they didn't listen to classical music very frequently or regularly, and who did not state they listened to world musics (including African, Oriental, and Indian) regularly or frequently.</p>

<h2>Comparison of average preference choices for the difference data sets.</h2>
<p>Extracting different data sets has been used to identify where there are clear differences in choice in preferred fragments based on musical experience.</p>
<p>My first approach was to compare the average percentage of choices for the system with the highest rated fragment to see if there was any marked difference between the sets. This was 
done by calculating the average number of people that chose the highest rated fragment of each pair. Each average was then multiplied by the mean preference scale choice in order to calculate the weight average number of people that 
preferred a fragment. (i.e., if in pair 1, 10 people chose the highest rated fragment, and the mean value of their choice on the preference scale (from 1 - 3) was 2, then I would multiply 10 by 2).
<p>The results of this process applied to the original data set (i.e. the set of all the responses), and data sets 1, 3, and 4 can be viewed here:</p>

<p><a href="documents/survey/percentagepreferences-set4.xls">Results for data set 4</a></p>
<br />

<h2>Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test</h2>
<p>I attempted to perform a Wilcoxon Signed Rank test assessment of the data, but I am uncertain as it how well this can be applied to the data. </p>
<p><a href="documents/survey/wilcox-rawdata.xls">My attempt is supplied here for completeness' sake. It has only been applied to the original data set.</a></p>
<br />

<h2>Pearson's Correlation Test</h2>
<p>Pearson's correlation test has been used to assess whether a correlation exists between a fragment receiving a higher percentage of votes if it's a higher rating fragment. This was done 
for percentages based with and without the preference scale weightings.</p>
<p>The percentage values were correlated against a fragment value, which was either of value 1 if it represented the fragment which received the highest rating of the pair, and 
a value of -1 if it represented a fragment with the lower rating of the pair.</p>
<p>The correlation calculations were done 
using the SAS program to perform the correlation analysis on the following sets of data:</p>

<p><a href="documents/survey/pearsons-set4.pdf">Correlation results for this data.</a></p>
<br />
<h2>Spearman's Rank Correlation Test</h2>
<p>Spearman's Rank Correlation has been applied to assess whether there exists a correlation between the difference between the system's rating of each fragment pair and 
the difference between the number of respondents that preferred each fragment.</p>
<p>The results for this test can be viewed here:</p>

<p><a href="documents/survey/spearmans-set3.xls">Results for data set 3.</a></p>
<p><a href="documents/survey/spearmans-set4.xls">Results for data set 4</a></p>
<br />

<h2>Preference Reasons Analysis</h2>
<p>SAS was used to ascertain whether there were any positive or negative correlations between the reasons respondents gave for preferring a fragment. For example, is there a 
correlation between respondents finding a piece of music 'more natural' and finding it to be 'more musical'? This was done separately for the set of responses which chose the higher 
rated fragment and the set of responses which chose the lower rated fragment.</p>
<p>The correlation data is provided below:</p>
<p><a href="documents/survey/Preferable-Comments-Correlations.pdf">The set of responses that chose the higher rated fragments.</a></p>
<p><a href="documents/survey/Unpreferable-Comments-Correlations.pdf">The set of responses that chose the lower rated fragments.</a></p>
<p><a href="documents/survey/allcomments-correlation.pdf">Correlation analysis of all the comments without separation according to fragment preference.</a></p>
<br />
<p><b>The data for the above analyses is based on these two data sets, which represents a count of how many people chose a given reason for preferring one fragment over another:</b></p>
