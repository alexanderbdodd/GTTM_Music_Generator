<h1>Program Output Examples</h1>
<p>This page provides links to example output material from the music generator program.</p>
<h2>Music Output Examples</h2>
<h3>Output Examples that have received a high rating from the system.</h3>
<p><a href="output-examples/High Rating Examples">Here are a selection of musical fragment outputs generated by the system which have been assigned a high rating by the system.</a></p>
<h3>Output Examples that have received a low rating from the system.</h3>
<p><a href="output-examples/Weak Rating Examples">Here are a selection of musical fragment outputs generated by the system which have been assigned a low rating by the system. </a></p>
<h3>Examples generated from different ratings</h3>
<p>The system makes use of different weights for different ratings to find weighted averages for rating values. I haven't had enough time to systematically test out different 
weightings systems, but I have done a brief, informal testing of different ratings. <a href="documents/Weightings Tests">The results can be found in this folder.</a></p>
<h3>Older examples from earlier versions of the program.</h3>
<p>Here are a selection of musical fragments produced at various stages of development of the program. <a href="output-examples/Old Examples"> The examples are found here.</a></p>
<h2>Grammar Illustration Examples</h2>
<p>As well as creating musical fragments, the program also generates grammar structures. The GrammarIllustrator class is used to generate visual representations of the generated 
grammar structures. <a href="output-examples/grammar-illustrations">Example illustrations can be viewed here.</a></p>
